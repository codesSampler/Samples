# Samples

This project contains sample codes of various problems that coders ususally find to be tackled on a daily basis
1) CamWork : This sample code halps you to take contol of your webcam(tested on laptop) and take snapshot and display it on the same canvas.
2) HLL : Its a simple implementation of the HLL algorithm using Microsoft's CardinalityEstimation nuget. In this the normal object containing distinct users are compressed and written in Binary format and then read, which would be required in case of solving space complexity problem.
